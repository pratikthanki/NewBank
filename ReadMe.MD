**NewBank**

NewBank is an idea for a new disrupter bank where customers can interact with their
accounts via a simple command-line interface.

**Current Functionality**

- User can enter a 'Username' and 'Password'.
- If the username matches to one of the test records, the user is authenticated and logged in.
- The user can then specify what they wish to do. At present, the only available option is SHOWMYACCOUNTS, which displays all accounts associated to that user and the current balance.

**Future Functionality**

Have a look at our Project Board to see what's in our backlog! :)
