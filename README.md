**NewBank**

NewBank is an idea for a new disrupter bank where customers can interact with their accounts via a simple 
command-line interface.


**Goals**

The goals of this project are;
1. To implement the functionality in the NewBank client and server code as initially described in the protocol
2. Further develop this protocol as new features are added
3. Develop a command line interface for customers of NewBank to interact with their
accounts
4. Develop new services for NewBank e.g. a micro-loan service


**Current Functionality**

- User can enter a 'Username' and 'Password'.
- If the username matches to one of the test records, the user is authenticated and logged in.
- The user can then specify what they wish to do. At present, the only available option is SHOWMYACCOUNTS, which 
displays all accounts associated to that user and the current balance.


**Future Functionality**

Have a look at our [Project Board](https://github.com/pratikthanki/NewBank/projects/1) to see what's in our backlog! :)


**Team Ethos**

- We work fast and continously write production-ready code.
- We merge to Master to reduce barriers of getting new features to users.
- We aim to move tasks across the board without being assigned to too many work items.
- We fix tests we break.
- We have fun :) 

**Best Practices**

- We create one branch per issue/ work item
- We include our initials and the feature in our branch names (i.e. `initials/name-of-feature`)
- We include useful commit messages that explain what we have done (no more than 50 characters).
- A single commit should only really include a single logical change.
- We handle large files using [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
- We follow [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style)
